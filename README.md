This repository contains code, datasets, a PowerPoint presentation (PPT), and a paper related to the implementation of machine learning techniques for diabetes prediction.

Code Overview
The code is implemented in two Jupyter Notebook files: 
ChatBot_Final_Project_1 and ChatBot_Final_Project_2. They have been stored under the folder titled “Code” 

Running the Code
To run the code, you'll need to have Jupyter Notebook installed on your system. You can install it via Anaconda or using pip:
pip install notebook
Once Jupyter Notebook is installed, simply open the desired notebook file (ChatBot_Final_Project_1.ipynb or ChatBot_Final_Project_2.ipynb) and execute the cells sequentially.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle. It is available as a CSV file named diabetes.csv. This dataset contains various features related to diabetes patients.
You can download the dataset from the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database

Additional Resources
PowerPoint Presentation (PPT): A presentation summarizing the project findings and methodologies is available in the presentation folder.
Paper: The detailed research paper associated with this project is stored in the paper folder.
